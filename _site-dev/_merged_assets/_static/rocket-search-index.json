He took higher ordination in Thailand and lived there for years before returning to Australia. He spent several years at Bodhinyana Monastery in Western Australia before going on to found Santi Forest Monastery in 2003 where he served as the abbot. Following Bhante Sujato's wishes, Santi became a nun's monastery in 2012, and he returned to live in Bodhinyana. \nIn 2005, Bhante Sujato co-founded the Buddhist website SuttaCentral along with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly, to provide access to early Buddhist texts in their original language and make translations available in modern languages. After being unable to secure copyright-free digital translations of the Pali Canon for SuttaCentral, Bhante Sujato moved to the island of Chimei, off the coast of Taiwan, to undertake the task of creating English translations of the four Nikāyas, living there from 2015 to 2018. These translations have since been published on SuttaCentral, and as free edition books. \nIn 2019, Bhante Sujato moved to Sydney to establish Lokanta Vihara (the Monastery at the End of the World) with his long term student, Bhante Akaliko, to explore what it means to follow the Buddha’s teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism, and political turmoil. He is also involved with Engaged Buddhism. Sujato aligns himself with anarcho-pacifism, which he explains as being compatible with Buddhist lay and renunciant life, as well as being in accord with the monastic vinaya. \nBhante Sujato along with his teacher Ajahn Brahm were involved with Re-establishing Bhikkhuni Ordination in the Forest sangha of Ajahn Chah. Sujato along with other scholars such as Brahm and Bhikkhu Analayo had come to the conclusion that there was no valid reason the extinct bhikkhuni order couldn't be re-established. The ordination ceremony led to Brahm's expulsion from the Thai Forest Lineage of Ajahn Chah. \n\n  \n    \n        \n         \n       \n\n  Show Navigation","section":"essays"},"16":{"title":"Bhikkhu Sujato: Samādhi is both a gathering and a fire","headline":"Bhikkhu Sujato: Samādhi is both a gathering and a fire","body":"As is well known, the Pali term jhāyati , better known in noun form as jhāna , draws upon two distinct roots, which take the same form in Pali. The two roots are to \"burn, glow, illuminate\" and to \"consider, ponder, ruminate\". \nIt seems that the term samādhi , which is usually synonymous with jhāna  in the EBTs, also draws on dual roots. This seems so obvious that I am surprised that I am surprised; probably someone has written about this; heck, I've probably done it myself! \nThe PTS dict acknowledges two main senses for the verb form samādahati , to gather or assemble, and to kindle a fire. The first sense is clearly the primary one in the context of meditation. However the second sense is well attested in Bhikkhu Pacittiya 56, which lays down an offence for a monk who lights a fire. Unfortunately, the rule analysis does not define samādahati . \nIn the past I have thought—and taught—that here it meant to \"assemble\" or put together the materials for the fire. However, this is incorrect, so I apologize to those I have misled. The rule states that it is an offence to samādahati  a fire, and this must be \"kindling\" the flame, rather than merely assembling the materials. \nWhile this dual sense is correctly acknowledged in the dictionary and translations, the dictionary gives only one etymology, to ādahati 1 , which itself derives from dahati 1 . Here the root is similar in meaning to the derived form, meaning to \"put\" or \"place\". \nHowever there is also a term dahati 2 , to burn. This must be the sense that is prominent in the \"kindling\" of fire. Thus samādahati  should be acknowledged to have two roots, or perhaps to be two distinct words. However in samādhi  the two senses would seem to be combined, in agreement with the very widespread use of imagery of light and radiance in the context of deep meditation. \nThe text that triggered this inquiry was SN 7.9. There, the Buddha is criticizing a brahmin for thinking that purity comes from lighting the sacred flame. \n\nMā brāhmaṇa dāru samādahāno \nWhen you’re kindling the firewood, brahmin,\nSuddhiṃ amaññi bahiddhā hi etaṃ; \ndon’t imagine this is purity, for it's just an external.    \n \nThis is of course part of the standard Buddhist critique of meaningless rituals. The ritual persists today; brahmanical priests still perform the agnihotra. \nIn the next verse, the Buddha says: \n\nHitvā ahaṃ brāhmaṇa dārudāhaṃ \nI've given up kindling firewood, brahmin,\nAjjhattamevujjalayāmi jotiṃ \nnow I just light the inner flame.    \n \nHere dāhaṁ  must belong to dahati 2 , and since this echoes the previous verse, samādahati  there must draw on the same root. The next lines emphasize this even more: \n\nNiccagginī niccasamāhitatto, \nAlways blazing, always converged (=\"akindle\"),\nArahaṃ ahaṃ brahmacariyaṃ carāmi. \nI am a perfected one living the spiritual life.    \n \nWow, so being on fire is directly paralleled with being in samādhi! \nAs so often in verse, the exact sense is a little ambiguous. In some cases, the past participle samāhita  is said to have the sense of \"comprised of\" rather than samādhi  in the sense of deep meditation, although I can't find strong support for this. (See AN 8.59, SN 2.6) It is possible, I guess, that the term here means something like \"always steady in oneself\". If it does refer to actual samādhi, it must be somewhat of a poetic expression, because the Buddha was obviously not literally in samādhi all the time. \nStill, regardless of the exact interpretation, the connection between samādahati  and fire is clear and strong.

Such point-by-point analogies are highly characteristic of the Upanishads, as they endeavor to evolve a higher spiritual sense of the Vedic rituals. By itself, however, this is not really remarkable enough to conclude there's an Upanishadic parallel. However, we find the Buddha saying: \n\nAttā sudanto purisassa joti \nThe well-tamed self is the light of a man.  \n \nThis is a very close analogue with the Brihadaranyaka, where King Janaka asks: \n\nyājñavalkya, kiṁ-jyotir ayam puruṣa iti \nYājñavalkya, what is the light of a man?  \n \nGiven that the terms for \"light\" and \"man\" here both have multiple possible synonyms, their concurrence here is unlikely to be an accident.

His question is somewhat elaborate and elevated praise of the Buddha, but boils down to what is the good conduct for both monastics and lay folk. Here are few translation issues. \nThe question of Dhammika is: \n\nKathaṅkaro sāvako sādhu hoti  \n \nNow we can read this as implying a change of state: how does a disciple act in order to become a good  disciple? Or more simply, \"how does a good disciple act?\" Norman has the former, Bodhi the latter. The verb hoti  in such cases can convey either sense. I feel that here it seems to be placed to convey the sense \"become\". \nThe phrase is echoed in verse 19, with the almost identical line: \n\nYathākaro sāvako sādhu hoti  \n \nHere both Norman and Bodhi have the \"become\" sense, with Bodhi rendering \"how one should act to become a good disciple\". Surely they should be consistent. \n\nwhat does one do to become a good disciple, \n \n\ndoing which one becomes a good disciple. \n \nIn verse 11 we have the lines; \n\nIriyāpathaṁ pabbajitānulomikaṁ\nSevetha naṁ atthadaso mutīmā.   \n \nThe tricky part is the phrase atthadasa . The suffix -dasa  means \"seer\". Attha  is possibly second only to dhamma  in its ambiguity, so it's often hard to parse out in context. Often it means simply \"the good\", \"benefit\", or \"goal\". Rather more technically it can mean \"meaning\" as in the interpretation of a text. Here, Norman has \"goal\" while Bodhi has \"the good\". In this context, I usually render \"meaning\", though without any great confidence. \nBut I think it is supported in this case. It's talking about someone at the beginning of their practice, who, having heard the teaching, would start practicing the lifestyle because they get the point, i.e. that this is something to be applied. \nThus: \n\nA reflective person, seeing the meaning,\nwould adopt the deportment proper to a renunciate.  \n \nAnother little detail where former translations can, I think, be improved is in the parsing of the two verses 17 and 18. We have one verse that speaks of how, when they had learned the Dhamma, a mendicant would make use of requisites such as almsfood and lodging, only after \"appraisal\". \nThis term saṅkhāya  is often rendered as \"reflected\" or similar, but the exact sense is a little more specific. It's related to the word to \"count\" and it means \"after appraisal, after assessment\". I'm trying to change all my translations to reflect this sense. Using \"reflects\" is not wrong, it's just a little vague. \nAnyway, the next verse repeats a similar phrase, but in a different voice: it starts with \"therefore\" and appears to speak of the mendicant in an indicative rather than optative voice. The verb is, however, implicit. Norman adds a (should) in brackets; but this basically makes the two verses have a similar meaning. Bodhi keeps the indicative sense, but renders the opening tasmā hi  as \"for\", which rather obscures the nature of the connection between the verses. A mendicant should be  careful when using requisites because they are  unsullied? \nThe point here is that, after hearing the Dhamma, and after carefully appraising the use of requisites, the mendicant makes use of them and that is why  they use them unsullied. \n\nAlms, a dwelling, a bed and seat,\nand water for rinsing the dust from the cloak--\nafter hearing the teaching of the Holy One,\na disciple of splendid wisdom would use these after appraisal.    \nThat's why, when it comes to alms and lodgings,\nand water for rinsing the dust from the cloak,\na mendicant is unsullied in the midst of these things,\nlike a droplet on a lotus-leaf.    \n \nOkay, so next we find in verse 23, a line about lying. It refers to different situations in which one would not lie. Now, in Buddhism, or early Buddhism at least, no lie is allowable. Yet the most serious lies are always said to be those in a formal context, much like our lying under oath. So here it begins by mentioning the sabhā  and the parisā  \"councils and assemblies\". \nSo far so good. But the next line has an idiom meaning something like \"one on one\". The connection between this and the previous line is not clear. \nNorman: \n\nWhen gone to the audience hall or assembly, he should not speak falsely to a single person. \n \nBodhi: \n\nOne who has entered a council or an assembly should not speak falsely to anyone. \n \nSo the sense from these translations seems to be that it refers to not lying to anyone at all in an assembly. \nHere it is with the Pali: \n\nSabhaggato vā parisaggato vā, \nGone to a council, or assembly,\nEkassa veko na musā bhaṇeyya \nor one on one, they would not lie.    \n \nThere seems to be three vā , i.e. three cases. (I.e. veko  resolves to vā eko . There is a variant ceko  but I don't think it materially affects the translation.) \nThus ekassa eko  doesn't mean \"a single person in the assembly\" it means that the rule applies, not just in an assembly, but also one on one. \nWell, that's about it I think, the rest has been well translated by the excellent scholars who have gone before me.","section":"essays"},"19":{"title":"Bhikkhu Sujato: Unimportant remarks on an important discourse: the traditions of the brahmins","headline":"Bhikkhu Sujato: Unimportant remarks on an important discourse: the traditions of the brahmins","body":"The Brāhmaṇadhammika (Snp 2.7) is a powerful and distinctive narrative that tells of the decline of the brahmins and the origin of the sacrifice. It shares something in common with the sprwaling mythic narratives of the Digha, but is much more focussed. \nThe Buddha I asked by some senior brahmins whether their contemporaries maintain the traditions of old, and the Buddha says no. This is in line with his position elsewhere, where he tends to treat the current brahmins as lesser sons of greater fathers. Sometimes, on the other hand, he dismisses the traditions altogether, arguing that even the composers of the Vedas knew nothing. \nThe description of the brahmins of old is similar to that found in, say, the Aggañña Sutta. For example, it's emphasized how they did not store food but relied on alms. This allows the Buddha to position his own followers as \"more brahmin than the brahmins\". \nAccording to the story, they used to practice the brahmacariya  for 48 years. This is evidently a reference to an early idea about the stages of life that was later codified. The notion appears elsewhere, where the term komarabrahmacariya  appears (an5.192:5.4), evidently having the sense of \"celibacy since youth\" i.e. \"virginity\". Komara  is added in brackets here, a very unusual intrusion in the text. It's probably inserted from the commentary by parallel with the prose. Nevertheless, it seems the sense is justified. \nThis text is that it adopts the point of view of the brahmins and their values in a way that's understandable given the context, but nonetheless can seem jarring. The Buddha, listing what he appears to be endorsing as the good practices of old, refers to the brahmins not marrying outside of caste, or avoiding sex during the \"infertile period\". (I have discussed this in more detail here. ) This tendency becomes especially strong at the end when the Buddha is said to describe them as having \"fallen away from the doctrine of caste\" (Jātivādaṁ nirākatvā ). I don't know, it makes me a little uncomfortable. \nMoving on, there are a few mistakes in earlier translations. Seeing as someone recently asked about Ven Thanissaro's translations, I'll include them here to see what turns up. \nIn verse 16 we find Kiccākiccesu , translated by Norman as \"what was to be done and what was not to be done\", by Bodhi as \"what was to be done and not done\", and by Thanissaro as \"what should &#x26; shouldn’t be done\". But this is an idiomatic phrase of a kind not uncommon in Pali. Phalāphala  means \"all kinds of fruit\", bhavābhava  means \"all kinds of rebirths\". Kiccākicca  likewise means \"all kinds of business\", as is clear from cases such as Thag 16.10:20.2. Here's Pārāpariya's rather memorable description of the monks of his days. \n\nBhesajjesu yathā vejjā,  \n \nIn medicine they are like doctors,\nkiccākicce yathā gihī \nin business like householders,\nGaṇikāva vibhūsāyaṁ, \nin makeup like prostitutes,\nissare khattiyā yathā. \nin sovereignty like lords. \n\nAt Snp 2.7:18.4 there's an interesting line used to describe the houses of the wealthy: \n\nVibhatte bhāgaso mite  \n \nNeatly laid out in measured rows. \nElsewhere the same phrase is used to describe the gates of hell. (an3.36:16.2). Evidently the Buddha was no great fan of the suburbs. \n\nAt Snp 2.7:20.1 it says that the brahmins fooled the kings with new scriptures. The Pali verb is gantheti  (\"have tied\"), which in later use literally means to \"write a book\" (i.e. a grantha ). The usage here in this sense is unusual, and I think it's earlier than any other case. The commentary is highly polemical and says they deliberately composed new scriptures. \nBut I'm not 100% sure that the text justifies this. I wonder whether it could mean \"selecting\" passages, i.e. \"making a compilation\". We know that this is a very common if not normal practice. \nIt's a lot easier to select some amenable passages to support your case than it is to create a whole new scripture. It's hard work! You have to compose the lines, organize it, make it appear authentic, and co-ordinate all this among a group of like-minded co-conspirators. \nReading it as \"compiling\" rather than composing is both more historically plausible and gentler on the brahmins. \n\nThe root that makes sacrifice possible is the king's excessive wealth. The underlying psychology is that inequality breeds jealousy and corruption. The king is encouraged to \"burn off\" his wealth in a display of conspicuous consumption. \nThis is, in fact, a legitimate anthropological theory of the origin of sacrifice (or at least one of them). In Melanesia, for example, the villages would have a \"big man\" who over time would gather greater shares of the village wealth, primarily pigs. At a certain point it would become unmanageable; what do you do with so many pigs? So they'd hold a great feast to which neighboring big men would be invited. It'd be an occasion to assert dominance and expand circles of influence. \nThe specifics of the sacrifice vary from place to place, but there must always be one thing that they share: someone has too much stuff and something has to give . \n\nThe text says that the brahmins had the king sacrifice \"many hundreds of thousands\" of cattle. No doubt this is an exaggeration, but it's not as unbelievable as it may sound. Sacrifices on this scale have been performed in modern times. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadhimai_festival  \nWe educated moderns may see talk of animal sacrifice as a peculiar, alien, or primitive rite, but it is still an ongoing reality in much of the world. The Buddha's movement to stamp it out is still in progress. \n\nI confess, I get a little teary at the climax of this sutta, the thought of the poor gentle cows being slaughtered for no reason. :cry: \nThe Buddha depicts the brahmanical deities as being outraged by this, roaring out adhamma ! \"It's against the Dhamma!\". Norman has \"(this is ) injustice!\", Bodhi \"How unrighteous!\", Thanissaro “An injustice!”. None of these, I feel, capture the force of the original. I have: \n\nAt that the gods and the ancestors, \n \nwith Indra, the titans and monsters,\nroared out: ‘This is a crime against nature!’\nas the sword fell on the cows.","section":"essays"},"20":{"title":"Blog","headline":"Blog","body":"Blogs by translators and associated scholars working on the Pali Translation Project.","section":"blog"},"21":{"title":"Blog","headline":"Introducing Pali translation project","body":"First steps towards a complete translation of Pali texts \n          ...read more","section":"blog"},"22":{"title":"Blog","headline":"Overcoming obstacles","body":"Next steps towards a complete translation of Pali texts \n          ...read more","section":"blog"},"a":{"title":"Essays","headline":"Essays","body":"Collected essays by translators and associated scholars working on the Pali Translation Project. \n\n  \n    \n        \n         \n       \n\n  Show Navigation","section":"essays"},"b":{"title":"Oxford Center for Buddhist Studies","headline":"Oxford Center for Buddhist Studies","body":"This is all about Oxford Center for Buddhist Studies, who we are and how we work. \n\n  \n    \n        \n         \n       \n\n  Show Navigation","section":"about"},"c":{"title":"Pali Translation Project","headline":"Pali Translation Project","body":"This is all about the Pali Translation Project, who we are and how we work. \n\n  \n    \n        \n         \n       \n\n  Show Navigation","section":"about"},"d":{"title":"SuttaCentral","headline":"SuttaCentral","body":"This is all about SuttaCentral, who we are and how we work. \n\n  \n    \n        \n         \n       \n\n  Show Navigation","section":"about"},"e":{"title":"Bhikkhu Brahmali","headline":"Bhikkhu Brahmali","body":"Show Navigation","section":"essays"},"f":{"title":"Others","headline":"Others","body":"Show Navigation","section":"essays"},"g":{"title":"Bhikkhu Sujato","headline":"Bhikkhu Sujato","body":"Bhante Sujato, known as Ajahn Sujato or Bhikkhu Sujato (born Anthony Best), is an Australian Theravada Buddhist monk who was ordained into in the Thai forest lineage of Ajahn Chah. \nA former musician with the post punk Australian band Martha's Vineyard, Sujato became a monk in 1994. He took higher ordination in Thailand and lived there for years before returning to Australia. He spent several years at Bodhinyana Monastery in Western Australia before going on to found Santi Forest Monastery in 2003 where he served as the abbot. Following Bhante Sujato's wishes, Santi became a nun's monastery in 2012, and he returned to live in Bodhinyana. \nIn 2005, Bhante Sujato co-founded the Buddhist website SuttaCentral along with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly, to provide access to early Buddhist texts in their original language and make translations available in modern languages. After being unable to secure copyright-free digital translations of the Pali Canon for SuttaCentral, Bhante Sujato moved to the island of Chimei, off the coast of Taiwan, to undertake the task of creating English translations of the four Nikāyas, living there from 2015 to 2018. These translations have since been published on SuttaCentral, and as free edition books. \nIn 2019, Bhante Sujato moved to Sydney to establish Lokanta Vihara (the Monastery at the End of the World) with his long term student, Bhante Akaliko, to explore what it means to follow the Buddha’s teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism, and political turmoil. He is also involved with Engaged Buddhism. Sujato aligns himself with anarcho-pacifism, which he explains as being compatible with Buddhist lay and renunciant life, as well as being in accord with the monastic vinaya. \nBhante Sujato along with his teacher Ajahn Brahm were involved with Re-establishing Bhikkhuni Ordination in the Forest sangha of Ajahn Chah. Sujato along with other scholars such as Brahm and Bhikkhu Analayo had come to the conclusion that there was no valid reason the extinct bhikkhuni order couldn't be re-established.

The two roots are to \"burn, glow, illuminate\" and to \"consider, ponder, ruminate\". \nIt seems that the term samādhi , which is usually synonymous with jhāna  in the EBTs, also draws on dual roots. This seems so obvious that I am surprised that I am surprised; probably someone has written about this; heck, I've probably done it myself! \nThe PTS dict acknowledges two main senses for the verb form samādahati , to gather or assemble, and to kindle a fire. The first sense is clearly the primary one in the context of meditation. However the second sense is well attested in Bhikkhu Pacittiya 56, which lays down an offence for a monk who lights a fire. Unfortunately, the rule analysis does not define samādahati . \nIn the past I have thought—and taught—that here it meant to \"assemble\" or put together the materials for the fire. However, this is incorrect, so I apologize to those I have misled. The rule states that it is an offence to samādahati  a fire, and this must be \"kindling\" the flame, rather than merely assembling the materials. \nWhile this dual sense is correctly acknowledged in the dictionary and translations, the dictionary gives only one etymology, to ādahati 1 , which itself derives from dahati 1 . Here the root is similar in meaning to the derived form, meaning to \"put\" or \"place\". \nHowever there is also a term dahati 2 , to burn. This must be the sense that is prominent in the \"kindling\" of fire. Thus samādahati  should be acknowledged to have two roots, or perhaps to be two distinct words. However in samādhi  the two senses would seem to be combined, in agreement with the very widespread use of imagery of light and radiance in the context of deep meditation. \nThe text that triggered this inquiry was SN 7.9. There, the Buddha is criticizing a brahmin for thinking that purity comes from lighting the sacred flame. \n\nMā brāhmaṇa dāru samādahāno \nWhen you’re kindling the firewood, brahmin,\nSuddhiṃ amaññi bahiddhā hi etaṃ; \ndon’t imagine this is purity, for it's just an external.    \n \nThis is of course part of the standard Buddhist critique of meaningless rituals. The ritual persists today; brahmanical priests still perform the agnihotra. \nIn the next verse, the Buddha says: \n\nHitvā ahaṃ brāhmaṇa dārudāhaṃ \nI've given up kindling firewood, brahmin,\nAjjhattamevujjalayāmi jotiṃ \nnow I just light the inner flame.    \n \nHere dāhaṁ  must belong to dahati 2 , and since this echoes the previous verse, samādahati  there must draw on the same root. The next lines emphasize this even more: \n\nNiccagginī niccasamāhitatto, \nAlways blazing, always converged (=\"akindle\"),\nArahaṃ ahaṃ brahmacariyaṃ carāmi. \nI am a perfected one living the spiritual life.    \n \nWow, so being on fire is directly paralleled with being in samādhi! \nAs so often in verse, the exact sense is a little ambiguous. In some cases, the past participle samāhita  is said to have the sense of \"comprised of\" rather than samādhi  in the sense of deep meditation, although I can't find strong support for this. (See AN 8.59, SN 2.6) It is possible, I guess, that the term here means something like \"always steady in oneself\". If it does refer to actual samādhi, it must be somewhat of a poetic expression, because the Buddha was obviously not literally in samādhi all the time. \nStill, regardless of the exact interpretation, the connection between samādahati  and fire is clear and strong. This is a rather interesting counterpoint to the whole nibbāna  as the going out of the flame thing. And another interesting question: I wonder whether samādhi  in the Hindu tradition retains the \"fire\" sense at all?","section":"essays"},"j":{"title":"Bhikkhu Sujato: Samādhi is both a gathering and a fire","headline":"An Upaniṣadic allusion","body":"Incidentally, in the same sutta we have a clear allusion to one of my favorite Upanishadic dialogues, Brihadaranyaka 4.3. \nIn SN 7.9, after the previously-discussed verses, the Buddha goes on to develop a set of correlations between a brahmin's ritual equipment and various ethical qualities.

The notion appears elsewhere, where the term komarabrahmacariya  appears (an5.192:5.4), evidently having the sense of \"celibacy since youth\" i.e. \"virginity\". Komara  is added in brackets here, a very unusual intrusion in the text. It's probably inserted from the commentary by parallel with the prose. Nevertheless, it seems the sense is justified. \nThis text is that it adopts the point of view of the brahmins and their values in a way that's understandable given the context, but nonetheless can seem jarring. The Buddha, listing what he appears to be endorsing as the good practices of old, refers to the brahmins not marrying outside of caste, or avoiding sex during the \"infertile period\". (I have discussed this in more detail here. ) This tendency becomes especially strong at the end when the Buddha is said to describe them as having \"fallen away from the doctrine of caste\" (Jātivādaṁ nirākatvā ). I don't know, it makes me a little uncomfortable. \nMoving on, there are a few mistakes in earlier translations. Seeing as someone recently asked about Ven Thanissaro's translations, I'll include them here to see what turns up. \nIn verse 16 we find Kiccākiccesu , translated by Norman as \"what was to be done and what was not to be done\", by Bodhi as \"what was to be done and not done\", and by Thanissaro as \"what should &#x26; shouldn’t be done\". But this is an idiomatic phrase of a kind not uncommon in Pali. Phalāphala  means \"all kinds of fruit\", bhavābhava  means \"all kinds of rebirths\". Kiccākicca  likewise means \"all kinds of business\", as is clear from cases such as Thag 16.10:20.2. Here's Pārāpariya's rather memorable description of the monks of his days. \n\nBhesajjesu yathā vejjā,  \n \nIn medicine they are like doctors,\nkiccākicce yathā gihī \nin business like householders,\nGaṇikāva vibhūsāyaṁ, \nin makeup like prostitutes,\nissare khattiyā yathā. \nin sovereignty like lords. \n\nAt Snp 2.7:18.4 there's an interesting line used to describe the houses of the wealthy: \n\nVibhatte bhāgaso mite  \n \nNeatly laid out in measured rows. \nElsewhere the same phrase is used to describe the gates of hell. (an3.36:16.2). Evidently the Buddha was no great fan of the suburbs. \n\nAt Snp 2.7:20.1 it says that the brahmins fooled the kings with new scriptures. The Pali verb is gantheti  (\"have tied\"), which in later use literally means to \"write a book\" (i.e. a grantha ). The usage here in this sense is unusual, and I think it's earlier than any other case. The commentary is highly polemical and says they deliberately composed new scriptures. \nBut I'm not 100% sure that the text justifies this. I wonder whether it could mean \"selecting\" passages, i.e. \"making a compilation\". We know that this is a very common if not normal practice. \nIt's a lot easier to select some amenable passages to support your case than it is to create a whole new scripture. It's hard work! You have to compose the lines, organize it, make it appear authentic, and co-ordinate all this among a group of like-minded co-conspirators. \nReading it as \"compiling\" rather than composing is both more historically plausible and gentler on the brahmins. \n\nThe root that makes sacrifice possible is the king's excessive wealth. The underlying psychology is that inequality breeds jealousy and corruption. The king is encouraged to \"burn off\" his wealth in a display of conspicuous consumption. \nThis is, in fact, a legitimate anthropological theory of the origin of sacrifice (or at least one of them). In Melanesia, for example, the villages would have a \"big man\" who over time would gather greater shares of the village wealth, primarily pigs. At a certain point it would become unmanageable; what do you do with so many pigs? So they'd hold a great feast to which neighboring big men would be invited. It'd be an occasion to assert dominance and expand circles of influence. \nThe specifics of the sacrifice vary from place to place, but there must always be one thing that they share: someone has too much stuff and something has to give . \n\nThe text says that the brahmins had the king sacrifice \"many hundreds of thousands\" of cattle. No doubt this is an exaggeration, but it's not as unbelievable as it may sound. Sacrifices on this scale have been performed in modern times. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadhimai_festival  \nWe educated moderns may see talk of animal sacrifice as a peculiar, alien, or primitive rite, but it is still an ongoing reality in much of the world. The Buddha's movement to stamp it out is still in progress. \n\nI confess, I get a little teary at the climax of this sutta, the thought of the poor gentle cows being slaughtered for no reason. :cry: \nThe Buddha depicts the brahmanical deities as being outraged by this, roaring out adhamma ! \"It's against the Dhamma!\". Norman has \"(this is ) injustice!\", Bodhi \"How unrighteous!\", Thanissaro “An injustice!”. None of these, I feel, capture the force of the original. I have: \n\nAt that the gods and the ancestors, \n \nwith Indra, the titans and monsters,\nroared out: ‘This is a crime against nature!’\nas the sword fell on the cows.","section":"essays"},"l":{"title":"Alexander Wynne","headline":"Alexander Wynne","body":"Show Navigation","section":"essays"},"m":{"title":"Blog","headline":"Blog","body":"Blogs by translators and associated scholars working on the Pali Translation Project.","section":"blog"},"n":{"title":"Blog","headline":"Introducing Pali translation project","body":"First steps towards a complete translation of Pali texts \n          ...read more","section":"blog"},"o":{"title":"Blog","headline":"Overcoming obstacles","body":"Next steps towards a complete translation of Pali texts \n          ...read more","section":"blog"},"p":{"title":"International Pali Translation Project","headline":"International Pali Translation ProjectAn initiative of the Oxford Center for Buddhist Studies in collaboration with SuttaCentral","body":"What has not been translated should be translated; what has been translated should be improved. \n\n\n  \n    About this project \n  \n    Essays by translators \n  \n    Updates on our blog"},"q":{"title":"International Pali Translation Project","headline":"Why translate Pali texts?Our job is not finished","body":"Since the 19th century, scholars have worked to translate important Pali texts into English.

He took higher ordination in Thailand and lived there for years before returning to Australia. He spent several years at Bodhinyana Monastery in Western Australia before going on to found Santi Forest Monastery in 2003 where he served as the abbot. Following Bhante Sujato's wishes, Santi became a nun's monastery in 2012, and he returned to live in Bodhinyana. \nIn 2005, Bhante Sujato co-founded the Buddhist website SuttaCentral along with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly, to provide access to early Buddhist texts in their original language and make translations available in modern languages. After being unable to secure copyright-free digital translations of the Pali Canon for SuttaCentral, Bhante Sujato moved to the island of Chimei, off the coast of Taiwan, to undertake the task of creating English translations of the four Nikāyas, living there from 2015 to 2018. These translations have since been published on SuttaCentral, and as free edition books. \nIn 2019, Bhante Sujato moved to Sydney to establish Lokanta Vihara (the Monastery at the End of the World) with his long term student, Bhante Akaliko, to explore what it means to follow the Buddha’s teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism, and political turmoil. He is also involved with Engaged Buddhism. Sujato aligns himself with anarcho-pacifism, which he explains as being compatible with Buddhist lay and renunciant life, as well as being in accord with the monastic vinaya. \nBhante Sujato along with his teacher Ajahn Brahm were involved with Re-establishing Bhikkhuni Ordination in the Forest sangha of Ajahn Chah. Sujato along with other scholars such as Brahm and Bhikkhu Analayo had come to the conclusion that there was no valid reason the extinct bhikkhuni order couldn't be re-established. The ordination ceremony led to Brahm's expulsion from the Thai Forest Lineage of Ajahn Chah. \n\n  \n    \n        \n         \n       \n\n  Show Navigation","section":"essays"},"1v":{"title":"Bhikkhu Sujato: A few rather insignificant notes on the Dhammika Sutta that you can mostly likely live without","headline":"Bhikkhu Sujato: A few rather insignificant notes on the Dhammika Sutta that you can mostly likely live without","body":"I'm picking up my translation work after something of a break, and I'd like to continue making a few little notes on things that I come across that may be of interest. \nThe Dhammikasutta (Snp 2.14) records the questions of a certain Dhammika, a layman with a retinue of 500 followers. His question is somewhat elaborate and elevated praise of the Buddha, but boils down to what is the good conduct for both monastics and lay folk. Here are few translation issues. \nThe question of Dhammika is: \n\nKathaṅkaro sāvako sādhu hoti  \n \nNow we can read this as implying a change of state: how does a disciple act in order to become a good  disciple? Or more simply, \"how does a good disciple act?\" Norman has the former, Bodhi the latter. The verb hoti  in such cases can convey either sense. I feel that here it seems to be placed to convey the sense \"become\". \nThe phrase is echoed in verse 19, with the almost identical line: \n\nYathākaro sāvako sādhu hoti  \n \nHere both Norman and Bodhi have the \"become\" sense, with Bodhi rendering \"how one should act to become a good disciple\". Surely they should be consistent. \n\nwhat does one do to become a good disciple, \n \n\ndoing which one becomes a good disciple. \n \nIn verse 11 we have the lines; \n\nIriyāpathaṁ pabbajitānulomikaṁ\nSevetha naṁ atthadaso mutīmā.   \n \nThe tricky part is the phrase atthadasa . The suffix -dasa  means \"seer\". Attha  is possibly second only to dhamma  in its ambiguity, so it's often hard to parse out in context. Often it means simply \"the good\", \"benefit\", or \"goal\". Rather more technically it can mean \"meaning\" as in the interpretation of a text. Here, Norman has \"goal\" while Bodhi has \"the good\". In this context, I usually render \"meaning\", though without any great confidence. \nBut I think it is supported in this case. It's talking about someone at the beginning of their practice, who, having heard the teaching, would start practicing the lifestyle because they get the point, i.e. that this is something to be applied. \nThus: \n\nA reflective person, seeing the meaning,\nwould adopt the deportment proper to a renunciate.  \n \nAnother little detail where former translations can, I think, be improved is in the parsing of the two verses 17 and 18. We have one verse that speaks of how, when they had learned the Dhamma, a mendicant would make use of requisites such as almsfood and lodging, only after \"appraisal\". \nThis term saṅkhāya  is often rendered as \"reflected\" or similar, but the exact sense is a little more specific. It's related to the word to \"count\" and it means \"after appraisal, after assessment\". I'm trying to change all my translations to reflect this sense. Using \"reflects\" is not wrong, it's just a little vague. \nAnyway, the next verse repeats a similar phrase, but in a different voice: it starts with \"therefore\" and appears to speak of the mendicant in an indicative rather than optative voice. The verb is, however, implicit. Norman adds a (should) in brackets; but this basically makes the two verses have a similar meaning. Bodhi keeps the indicative sense, but renders the opening tasmā hi  as \"for\", which rather obscures the nature of the connection between the verses. A mendicant should be  careful when using requisites because they are  unsullied? \nThe point here is that, after hearing the Dhamma, and after carefully appraising the use of requisites, the mendicant makes use of them and that is why  they use them unsullied. \n\nAlms, a dwelling, a bed and seat,\nand water for rinsing the dust from the cloak--\nafter hearing the teaching of the Holy One,\na disciple of splendid wisdom would use these after appraisal.    \nThat's why, when it comes to alms and lodgings,\nand water for rinsing the dust from the cloak,\na mendicant is unsullied in the midst of these things,\nlike a droplet on a lotus-leaf.    \n \nOkay, so next we find in verse 23, a line about lying. It refers to different situations in which one would not lie. Now, in Buddhism, or early Buddhism at least, no lie is allowable. Yet the most serious lies are always said to be those in a formal context, much like our lying under oath. So here it begins by mentioning the sabhā  and the parisā  \"councils and assemblies\". \nSo far so good. But the next line has an idiom meaning something like \"one on one\". The connection between this and the previous line is not clear. \nNorman: \n\nWhen gone to the audience hall or assembly, he should not speak falsely to a single person. \n \nBodhi: \n\nOne who has entered a council or an assembly should not speak falsely to anyone. \n \nSo the sense from these translations seems to be that it refers to not lying to anyone at all in an assembly. \nHere it is with the Pali: \n\nSabhaggato vā parisaggato vā, \nGone to a council, or assembly,\nEkassa veko na musā bhaṇeyya \nor one on one, they would not lie.    \n \nThere seems to be three vā , i.e. three cases. (I.e. veko  resolves to vā eko . There is a variant ceko  but I don't think it materially affects the translation.) \nThus ekassa eko  doesn't mean \"a single person in the assembly\" it means that the rule applies, not just in an assembly, but also one on one. \nWell, that's about it I think, the rest has been well translated by the excellent scholars who have gone before me.","section":"essays"},"1w":{"title":"Bhikkhu Sujato: Samādhi is both a gathering and a fire","headline":"Bhikkhu Sujato: Samādhi is both a gathering and a fire","body":"As is well known, the Pali term jhāyati , better known in noun form as jhāna , draws upon two distinct roots, which take the same form in Pali. The two roots are to \"burn, glow, illuminate\" and to \"consider, ponder, ruminate\". \nIt seems that the term samādhi , which is usually synonymous with jhāna  in the EBTs, also draws on dual roots. This seems so obvious that I am surprised that I am surprised; probably someone has written about this; heck, I've probably done it myself! \nThe PTS dict acknowledges two main senses for the verb form samādahati , to gather or assemble, and to kindle a fire. The first sense is clearly the primary one in the context of meditation. However the second sense is well attested in Bhikkhu Pacittiya 56, which lays down an offence for a monk who lights a fire. Unfortunately, the rule analysis does not define samādahati . \nIn the past I have thought—and taught—that here it meant to \"assemble\" or put together the materials for the fire. However, this is incorrect, so I apologize to those I have misled. The rule states that it is an offence to samādahati  a fire, and this must be \"kindling\" the flame, rather than merely assembling the materials. \nWhile this dual sense is correctly acknowledged in the dictionary and translations, the dictionary gives only one etymology, to ādahati 1 , which itself derives from dahati 1 . Here the root is similar in meaning to the derived form, meaning to \"put\" or \"place\". \nHowever there is also a term dahati 2 , to burn. This must be the sense that is prominent in the \"kindling\" of fire. Thus samādahati  should be acknowledged to have two roots, or perhaps to be two distinct words. However in samādhi  the two senses would seem to be combined, in agreement with the very widespread use of imagery of light and radiance in the context of deep meditation. \nThe text that triggered this inquiry was SN 7.9. There, the Buddha is criticizing a brahmin for thinking that purity comes from lighting the sacred flame. \n\nMā brāhmaṇa dāru samādahāno \nWhen you’re kindling the firewood, brahmin,\nSuddhiṃ amaññi bahiddhā hi etaṃ; \ndon’t imagine this is purity, for it's just an external.    \n \nThis is of course part of the standard Buddhist critique of meaningless rituals. The ritual persists today; brahmanical priests still perform the agnihotra. \nIn the next verse, the Buddha says: \n\nHitvā ahaṃ brāhmaṇa dārudāhaṃ \nI've given up kindling firewood, brahmin,\nAjjhattamevujjalayāmi jotiṃ \nnow I just light the inner flame.    \n \nHere dāhaṁ  must belong to dahati 2 , and since this echoes the previous verse, samādahati  there must draw on the same root. The next lines emphasize this even more: \n\nNiccagginī niccasamāhitatto, \nAlways blazing, always converged (=\"akindle\"),\nArahaṃ ahaṃ brahmacariyaṃ carāmi. \nI am a perfected one living the spiritual life.    \n \nWow, so being on fire is directly paralleled with being in samādhi! \nAs so often in verse, the exact sense is a little ambiguous. In some cases, the past participle samāhita  is said to have the sense of \"comprised of\" rather than samādhi  in the sense of deep meditation, although I can't find strong support for this. (See AN 8.59, SN 2.6) It is possible, I guess, that the term here means something like \"always steady in oneself\". If it does refer to actual samādhi, it must be somewhat of a poetic expression, because the Buddha was obviously not literally in samādhi all the time. \nStill, regardless of the exact interpretation, the connection between samādahati  and fire is clear and strong. This is a rather interesting counterpoint to the whole nibbāna  as the going out of the flame thing. And another interesting question: I wonder whether samādhi  in the Hindu tradition retains the \"fire\" sense at all?","section":"essays"},"1x":{"title":"Bhikkhu Sujato: Samādhi is both a gathering and a fire","headline":"An Upaniṣadic allusion","body":"Incidentally, in the same sutta we have a clear allusion to one of my favorite Upanishadic dialogues, Brihadaranyaka 4.3. \nIn SN 7.9, after the previously-discussed verses, the Buddha goes on to develop a set of correlations between a brahmin's ritual equipment and various ethical qualities. Such point-by-point analogies are highly characteristic of the Upanishads, as they endeavor to evolve a higher spiritual sense of the Vedic rituals. By itself, however, this is not really remarkable enough to conclude there's an Upanishadic parallel. However, we find the Buddha saying: \n\nAttā sudanto purisassa joti \nThe well-tamed self is the light of a man.  \n \nThis is a very close analogue with the Brihadaranyaka, where King Janaka asks: \n\nyājñavalkya, kiṁ-jyotir ayam puruṣa iti \nYājñavalkya, what is the light of a man?  \n \nGiven that the terms for \"light\" and \"man\" here both have multiple possible synonyms, their concurrence here is unlikely to be an accident. The text enters into a playful dialogue between the king and the sage , until finally Yājñavalkya is made to divulge that the self (ātman ) is a man's true light. As to what that self is: \n\nyo’yaṁ vijñānamayaḥ prāṇeṣu, hṛdy antarjyotiḥ puruṣaḥ \nIt is that man made of consciousness among the vital energies/senses, the inner light of the heart. \n \nAs always, while the language is clearly related, the Buddha avoids the metaphysical implications, preferring a practical and ethical teaching.","section":"essays"},"1y":{"title":"Alexander Wynne","headline":"Alexander Wynne","body":"Show Navigation","section":"essays"},"1z":{"title":"Bhikkhu Sujato: Unimportant remarks on an important discourse: the traditions of the brahmins","headline":"Bhikkhu Sujato: Unimportant remarks on an important discourse: the traditions of the brahmins","body":"The Brāhmaṇadhammika (Snp 2.7) is a powerful and distinctive narrative that tells of the decline of the brahmins and the origin of the sacrifice. It shares something in common with the sprwaling mythic narratives of the Digha, but is much more focussed. \nThe Buddha I asked by some senior brahmins whether their contemporaries maintain the traditions of old, and the Buddha says no. This is in line with his position elsewhere, where he tends to treat the current brahmins as lesser sons of greater fathers. Sometimes, on the other hand, he dismisses the traditions altogether, arguing that even the composers of the Vedas knew nothing. \nThe description of the brahmins of old is similar to that found in, say, the Aggañña Sutta. For example, it's emphasized how they did not store food but relied on alms. This allows the Buddha to position his own followers as \"more brahmin than the brahmins\". \nAccording to the story, they used to practice the brahmacariya  for 48 years. This is evidently a reference to an early idea about the stages of life that was later codified. The notion appears elsewhere, where the term komarabrahmacariya  appears (an5.192:5.4), evidently having the sense of \"celibacy since youth\" i.e. \"virginity\". Komara  is added in brackets here, a very unusual intrusion in the text. It's probably inserted from the commentary by parallel with the prose. Nevertheless, it seems the sense is justified. \nThis text is that it adopts the point of view of the brahmins and their values in a way that's understandable given the context, but nonetheless can seem jarring. The Buddha, listing what he appears to be endorsing as the good practices of old, refers to the brahmins not marrying outside of caste, or avoiding sex during the \"infertile period\". (I have discussed this in more detail here. ) This tendency becomes especially strong at the end when the Buddha is said to describe them as having \"fallen away from the doctrine of caste\" (Jātivādaṁ nirākatvā ). I don't know, it makes me a little uncomfortable. \nMoving on, there are a few mistakes in earlier translations. Seeing as someone recently asked about Ven Thanissaro's translations, I'll include them here to see what turns up. \nIn verse 16 we find Kiccākiccesu , translated by Norman as \"what was to be done and what was not to be done\", by Bodhi as \"what was to be done and not done\", and by Thanissaro as \"what should &#x26; shouldn’t be done\". But this is an idiomatic phrase of a kind not uncommon in Pali. Phalāphala  means \"all kinds of fruit\", bhavābhava  means \"all kinds of rebirths\". Kiccākicca  likewise means \"all kinds of business\", as is clear from cases such as Thag 16.10:20.2. Here's Pārāpariya's rather memorable description of the monks of his days. \n\nBhesajjesu yathā vejjā,  \n \nIn medicine they are like doctors,\nkiccākicce yathā gihī \nin business like householders,\nGaṇikāva vibhūsāyaṁ, \nin makeup like prostitutes,\nissare khattiyā yathā. \nin sovereignty like lords. \n\nAt Snp 2.7:18.4 there's an interesting line used to describe the houses of the wealthy: \n\nVibhatte bhāgaso mite  \n \nNeatly laid out in measured rows. \nElsewhere the same phrase is used to describe the gates of hell. (an3.36:16.2). Evidently the Buddha was no great fan of the suburbs. \n\nAt Snp 2.7:20.1 it says that the brahmins fooled the kings with new scriptures. The Pali verb is gantheti  (\"have tied\"), which in later use literally means to \"write a book\" (i.e. a grantha ). The usage here in this sense is unusual, and I think it's earlier than any other case. The commentary is highly polemical and says they deliberately composed new scriptures. \nBut I'm not 100% sure that the text justifies this. I wonder whether it could mean \"selecting\" passages, i.e. \"making a compilation\". We know that this is a very common if not normal practice. \nIt's a lot easier to select some amenable passages to support your case than it is to create a whole new scripture. It's hard work! You have to compose the lines, organize it, make it appear authentic, and co-ordinate all this among a group of like-minded co-conspirators. \nReading it as \"compiling\" rather than composing is both more historically plausible and gentler on the brahmins. \n\nThe root that makes sacrifice possible is the king's excessive wealth. The underlying psychology is that inequality breeds jealousy and corruption. The king is encouraged to \"burn off\" his wealth in a display of conspicuous consumption. \nThis is, in fact, a legitimate anthropological theory of the origin of sacrifice (or at least one of them). In Melanesia, for example, the villages would have a \"big man\" who over time would gather greater shares of the village wealth, primarily pigs. At a certain point it would become unmanageable; what do you do with so many pigs? So they'd hold a great feast to which neighboring big men would be invited. It'd be an occasion to assert dominance and expand circles of influence. \nThe specifics of the sacrifice vary from place to place, but there must always be one thing that they share: someone has too much stuff and something has to give . \n\nThe text says that the brahmins had the king sacrifice \"many hundreds of thousands\" of cattle. No doubt this is an exaggeration, but it's not as unbelievable as it may sound. Sacrifices on this scale have been performed in modern times. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadhimai_festival  \nWe educated moderns may see talk of animal sacrifice as a peculiar, alien, or primitive rite, but it is still an ongoing reality in much of the world. The Buddha's movement to stamp it out is still in progress. \n\nI confess, I get a little teary at the climax of this sutta, the thought of the poor gentle cows being slaughtered for no reason. :cry: \nThe Buddha depicts the brahmanical deities as being outraged by this, roaring out adhamma ! \"It's against the Dhamma!\". Norman has \"(this is ) injustice!\", Bodhi \"How unrighteous!\", Thanissaro “An injustice!”. None of these, I feel, capture the force of the original. I have: \n\nAt that the gods and the ancestors, \n \nwith Indra, the titans and monsters,\nroared out: ‘This is a crime against nature!’\nas the sword fell on the cows.","section":"essays"}}}
